## Branch Etiquette
Please always *fork* from the `development`-branch. *Pull-Requests* should also be made into this branch. The `main`-branch represents the current code in live production.

### Branch Naming
To have a better overview, please name your branches according to the following scheme:

- `feature/`: This branch introduces a new feature
- `bugfix/`: This branch fixes a bug

*Example:* A branch introducing a new proceeds widget would be named `feature/proceeds-widget`.

## Pull Requests
To make it easier for us to review your pull requests, a descriptive title and description is much apreciated. We also encourage you to use *labels*. When you are still working on the branch, preceed the pull Request title with `[WIP]`.
In order for the Pull Request to be merged, it must pass all swiftlint checks.
